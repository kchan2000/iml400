Cybernetic Garden is an interactive web page inspired by the poem _All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace_ by Richard Brautigan.


**Description**

The way I interpreted the poem by Richard Brautigan was "how does a more habitable digital world look like?" My response to this question was based in the pandemic and lockdown where I was experiencing an increasingly unhealthy relationship with technology (specifically my screen time). There were three main elements to this garden, the first being the screenshots of my text messages with friends, the "im feeling" button, and Lauv's song "Modern Loneliness."

For the screenshots, I went throught my messages and searched for words such as "miss", "facetime", "call", etc. I noticed that much of the time it was my friends reaching out to me rather than the other way around and even though I miss them very much as well, it is difficult for me to text and call because I just prefer in-person conversation. This is the great paradox of me and this generation because we have access to technology that keeps us all connected easier, yet I still feel lonley. The messages are layered and as the viewer clicks through them, they strip away till the last message which is me quoting Lauv's song: "I love my friends to death but I never call and I never text." This line just captures my relationship with technology and the emotions I feel towards my friends. As the viewer clicks the last text, the rest repopulate. 

For the "im feeling" button, I took all the most recent emojis I used in my phone created an overlay. Once this button is clicked, the viewer is unable to interact with any other part of the site. It acts as a way to confront and work through one's emotions, no matter how overwhelming, and to just sit and pause. I was surprised as to how much my emojis actually reflected what I was feeling.

Lastly, the song "Modern Loneliness" sets the tone for the whole garden. Its lyrics explains exactly how I feel a lot of the time.

For the background, I used the OG Microsoft XP background because I felt for my generation, this was the original cybernetic garden. This is where a lot of our journey's with the internet and technology started. It was homage to that stage of our lives. I included that photo of myself as a toddler because it looked like I was sitting on the hill, and I feel like it also emphasizes how young we were exposed to technology. We are truly "digital natives" and we have yet to see what the future for this means. I included three gifs of gems and crystals because I liked the way they tied into my accidental 90s aesthetic through their color scheme.
