# My Cybernetic gGarden

Cybernetic Garden is an interactive web page inspired by the poem _All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace_ by Richard Brautigan.


**Description**

The way I interpreted the poem by Richard Brautigan was "how does a more habitable digital world look like?" My response to this question was based in the pandemic and lockdown where I was experiencing an increasingly unhealthy relationship with technology (specifically my screen time).
