        <p>
            Mindy Seu’s “Cyberfeminism Index'' is an ongoing collection of works, websites, events, etc. that are about cyberfeminism and explored intersectionality in the digital space. It was beautiful to see how many people were thinking about this topic and applying it in different forms and browsing through the tabs felt like I was peeking into a little community.

            <br>
            <br>
            Chapter 6 of Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren F. Klein’s Data Feminism was about considering context when it came to data science and data feminism. They coined the term “Big Dick Data” which are data projects that are “characterized by partriarchial, cis-masculinist, totalizing fantasies of world domination as enacted through data capture…” it ignores context, fetishezes size, and inflastes technical and scientific capabilities. I thought this was a really funny,yet accurate way to describe these projects (akin to big dick energy).

            <br>
            <br>
            They also discuss how we have put so much emphasis on the importance of “raw data” to tell a story, but the biggest flaw with that is that context can’t be ignored. The numbers do not speak for themselves which is why we need to be more critical about the context, limitations, and validity of the data under use. We must always consider context! This reminded me of this site <a href="https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations">https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations</a> where random things can correlate by chance and individuals can take that without thinking deeper about the context, and that can be dangerous (although the tone of this site is very much about being goofy).

            The last reading was “She Who Sees The Unknown: The Archive” and I loved the design and intention of the site. Even when just reading the name, it already felt comforting in a sense because it felt like the narrative was clearly centered around a female figure, despite what the work even was and I loved that.
            <br>
            <br>
            How does cyberfeminism relate to xenofeminism?
            <br>
            Are there any instances in which you were presented a big piece of data without context? 
            <br>
            Is there anything that you can add to the Cyberfeminism Index/ will you add to it in the future?
