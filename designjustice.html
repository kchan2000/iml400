            The EYEO talk by Sasha Costanza- Chock felt like the “Avengers Assemble” of all the readings we had previously done. They mentioned Mother Cyborg, the media communities in Detroit, Kimberle Crenshaw, the Consentful Tech zine, and even “How to Make Breast Pumps Not Suck” (which is a project someone at my work helped create!) and it was really nice to understand the references that were being made -- I felt like I had traversed much more in this community. The talk itself is centered around what design justice is and means. Design justice centers those who are normally marginalized by design and uses collaborative practices to address different challenges the community faces. The talk and the Design Justice Principles page was, personally, a huge privilege check. Hearing Sasha’s story at the airport just reminded me about all the things that are designed in the world that work for me whereas for so many others, it is something that works against them. Our designed realities are not inclusive and that just reinforces the importance of design justice. It brings to mind what designers mean when they say “empowering the user” or the buzzword of “human-centered design” that is always thrown around. What do these words really mean and just how empty are they?

           It was interesting to hear about the employees at large tech companies revolting against company-wide initiatives, but how can the culture shift to encapsulate more of the design justice principles?

            <br>
         We take various design courses in MA+P, how can these principles be better incorported in our curriculum?
