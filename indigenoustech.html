            “What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous technology” is a poem, I believe, explaining the nuances and elements of Indigenous tech. This poem beautifully presented the ways in which sustainability and technology can and should be intersected. The line that really caught my attention was “Indigenous technology has a different life trajectory than a fax machine.” These values and techniques reminded me a lot of Indigenous land stewardship as they are very similar to the way they approach tech: sustainable with future generations kept in mind. It is all about a conservation-based economy and approach to the environment and everything around it.

            “Post- Colonial Computing” was a really interesting read about reframing the narrative in tech and design. It addressed the issues surrounding cultural competency and the importance of taking a holistic approach to design. I appreciate how this is a non-tangible approach, but rather a way to ask questions and a mode of investigation in this field. This read reminds us of the importance of diversity and inclusion in technology.

            <br>
            How can Indigenous technology survive under a capitalist and consumerist structure where the need to have the “next best thing” is so apparent?
            <br>
            <br>
            How do we start facilitating conversations around “postcolonial computing” in our discussion and curriculum?
            <br>
            <br>
            What does Indigenous technology look like now in the tech space? Are there any examples that come to mind?
