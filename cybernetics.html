        <p>
            “Where Deer Stroll Peacefully Past Computers” dug deeper into a perspective of technology that I hadn’t thought too deeply about before, and that is: how care plays into technology, or rather how there isn’t enough care in tech currently. I loved how recent and relevant these examples of care and tech were because I believe everyone’s relationship with technology changed during the pandemic. For myself, I see a much heavier reliance on tech in different ways (Zoom for everything, 2-hour long Facetimes with friends I haven’t seen for almost a year, and even stalking the Spotify Friend’s Feed to try to feel some sort of collective presence). In this regard, I feel grateful for technology in keeping society moving forward in some ways. But at the same time, I see my screen time skyrocketing (consuming upwards of almost a quarter of the hours in my day), alongside higher feelings of anxiety I didn’t feel before. This is what made what they were exploring, “what a more habitable digital world might look like,” all the more interesting. Using the word “habitable” to describe what we don’t have was accurate. There is not a sustainable healthy way we interact with technology...yet.

            Does cutting out tech and social media have to mean social isolation?
            <br>
            <br>
            How can we stay connected while also reducing screen time?
            <br>
            <br>
            What has the pandemic taught us about our relationship with technology and how we can improve it?
