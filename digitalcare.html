         All the readings for this week felt so relevant and important. 
         
         First, Mother Cyborg, or Diana Nucera's talk, was so eye opening and enlightening. Much of the talk centered around her work in Detroit around digital literacy, broadband internet access, and community-building (online and offline). This talk was given in 2019, but I couldn't stop thinking about how these unaddressed issues of access are affecting millions of people more than ever during the pandemic today. I have seen many articles and short documentaries about how the digital divide is causing many kids to fall behind in school during remote education. It's heartbreaking to see how inequalities are being gauged deeper and deeper, and is a stark reminder as to how internet should be a human right.

        The Virtual Care Lab was a hub for all things digital care. I really enjoyed exploring their projects and it looked like they had a lot of exciting meetings and workshops coming up. Their 48 hour party video reminded me a lot of a NYT Op-Docs that I had watched earlier this year called "Vogueing Has Always Been a Protest." It was about how during lockdown when balls were no longer in person, the vogueing community turned to virtual ballrooms on sites such as Bigo. It was all about how to foster and maintain community online and that is something that the Virtual Care Lab does as well.

        From all these readings, I have gathered that digital care is not only about our relationship with technology, but is also heavily rooted in community and mutual aid. It is all about how we can create spaces for care and discussion on the internet. Some questions that I have are:
        <br> 
        <br>
        How are we, as MA+P students, engaging in media-based organizing? What are some tools we have created or learned about?
        <br>
        <br>
        What do governments/companies/organizations need to do to make internet a human right?
