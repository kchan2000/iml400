            “Designing for Cognitive Differences” was an extremely informative and eye-opening article. Like the author mentions, when we think about “inclusive design” and accessibility our minds usually go to “designing for the blind or deaf” when there is actually much more to it. There was definitely a gap in my own knowledge when it came to designing for cognitive differences and I really appreciated how the author addressed specific issues in design such as forms and motion and provided solutions and alternatives. It was a big privilege check because these were all things I never considered or thought about when browsing the web and I think as a learning designer, it was really important for me to see this.

           Christine Sun Kim’s TED Talk about the similarities between ASL and music was so beautiful and it all just made so much sense. I had actually come across her work during the lockdown on Instagram when there was a post of hers that was being shared around. I don’t remember the exact post but I remember looking through her work and being exposed to what it means to be hard of hearing and deaf. Her illustrations and art was super witty and approached the topic in a really smart way especially for those who are not familiar with it.

            How can we shift the culture of design to prioritize accessibility?
